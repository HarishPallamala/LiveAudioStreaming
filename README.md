# LiveAudioStreaming
Every time we watch a live stream or audio on demand, streaming protocols are used to transmit data over the internet. Audio streaming from one device to another device can be done using either UDP or TCP over different computer networks. Using UDP to stream audio or videos is common. It is efficient and any loss of packets or out-of-order packets will cause minimal problems. We will illustrate this technique by steaming live audio. A UDP server will capture the microphone's sound and send it to a client. The UDP client will receive the audio and play it on the system's speakers. The idea of a UDP streaming server is to break up the stream into a series of packets that are sent to a UDP client. The client will then receive these packets and use them to reconstitute a stream. In order to illustrate streaming audio, we need to know a bit about how Java handles audio streams. Audio is handled by a series of classes that are found in the javax.sound.sampled package.
KEY WORDS: UDP, Connection, Microphone, UDP regardless of bandwidth constrains, UDP faster and riskier
